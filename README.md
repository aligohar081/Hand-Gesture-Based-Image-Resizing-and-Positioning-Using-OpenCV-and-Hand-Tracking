# Hand-Gesture-Based-Image-Resizing-and-Positioning-Using-OpenCV-and-Hand-Tracking
This project uses computer vision to track hand gestures via a webcam, enabling dynamic image resizing and positioning. It integrates OpenCV for image processing and cvzone.HandTrackingModule for hand tracking, allowing users to intuitively control an image's size and position through gestures.
